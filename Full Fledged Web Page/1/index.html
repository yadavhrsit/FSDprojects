            <p>
                Ecom Express Limited is a leading end-to-end technology enabled logistics solutions provider to the
                Indian e-commerce industry. Headquartered in Gurugram, Haryana, Ecom Express was incorporated in 2012 by
                T. A. Krishnan, Manju Dhawan, K. Satyanarayana and Late. Sanjeev Saxena with their 100+ years of
                cumulative experience in the Indian logistics and distribution industry.<br>
                <br>
                The company has established its presence in the industry due to a differentiated business model which is
                built on delivery service capability, scalability, customization and sustainability. Ecom Express uses
                cutting-edge technology and automated solutions to enable first-mile pickup, processing, network
                optimization and last mile delivery. The company’s products include Ecom Express Services (EXS), Ecom
                Fulfilment Services (EFS) and Ecom Digital Services (EDS).<br>
                <br>
                Ecom Express has its presence in all 29 states of the country and operates in over 2650+ towns across
                27,000+ PIN-codes in India. The company is the first private logistics company in India to envision a
                full-state coverage strategy, i.e., the capability to reach every doorstep in every city, town and
                village in a state. This full-state coverage is offered in 25 states, including Andhra Pradesh, Assam,
                Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh,
                Maharashtra, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Through
                this deep reach strategy, the company has a capability to deliver to over 1.2 billion people, i.e., 95%+
                of India’s population.<br>
                <br>
                After establishing a solid foothold in India, Ecom Express marked its maiden venture outside the country
                in early 2021 with its investment in Paperfly, Bangladesh’s largest third-party e-commerce logistics
                (3PL) firm.

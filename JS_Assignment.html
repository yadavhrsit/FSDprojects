    <h2>Q1: Y2K problem: Databases written in 1970's used 2-digit fields to represent the year e.g.,
    77, 80 instead of 1977, 1980.However with the year 2000 nearby all these fields had to be changed to be 4-digit date. 
    Write a program to change a given 2-digit year to a 4-digit year. Remember that if the 2-digit number is less than 35
    it means it’s a year in the 2000-year range. E.g., 15 would mean 2015 not 1915.

    <h2>Q2. In a board game, a piece may advance 1-6 tiles forward depending on the number rolled on a six-sided dice.
        If you advance your piece onto the same tile as another player's piece, both of you earn a bonus.
        Can you reach your friend's tile number in the next roll? 
        Create a function that takes your position a and your friend's position b and returns a boolean representation of 
        whether it's possible to earn a bonus on any dice roll.
        Examples
        possibleBonus(3, 7) true
        possibleBonus(1, 9) false
        possibleBonus(5, 3) false

        Q3.  Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (num, length) and returns an array of multiples of num until the array length reaches length.
        Example: -arrayOfMultiples(12, 10) ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]
        Notes: -Notice that num is also included in the returned array.
